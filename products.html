                <p>
                  geotextiles are manufactured from high tenacity multifilament
                  polyester yarns and have high tensile strengths, low
                  elongation and low creep. These are suitable for applications
                  involving the function of reinforcement. The geotextile also
                  has low opening size and adequate permeability, enabling them
                  to perform the function of separation also. The multifilament
                  geotextile are an ideal replacement for the costly natural
                  filter media.

                <h3>Cement Fiber</h3>
                <p>
                  Our unique cement fibre gives better anchoring with concrete
                  which is found in most of the fibres available worldwide. This
                  fibre specially designed to form an internal support system
                  for concrete when it need the most because concrete is
                  relatively brittle and lacks flexural strength and there is
                  always a chance to crack the concrete at its both
                  stages(plastic and hardened). Concrete get cracked cause of
                  shrinkage which can be get out over the months or years after
                  drying.In either case, these cracks can jeopardize the overall
                  integrity of the concrete and not allow it to maintain - or
                  possibly ever attain - its maximum performance capability. Our
                  product can provide a solution to most of these problems. Our
                  product can arrest cracks, increases resistance to
                  impact/abrasion & greatly improves quality of construction in
                  walls, foundations, tanks, roads and precast products like
                  blocks, pipes, tiles, manhole covers, and more. Reinforced
                  concrete itself is a composite material, where the
                  reinforcement acts as the strengthening fibre and the concrete
                  as the matrix. lt is therefore imperative that the behaviour
                  under thermal stresses for the two materials be similar so
                  that the differential deformations of concrete and the
                  reinforcement are minimized. It has been recognized that the
                  addition of small, closely spaced and uniform\y dispersed
                  fibres to concrete would act as crack arrester and would
                  substantially improve its static and dynamic properties. Such
                  type of fibres not only retards crack initiation but also
                  reduces. It is necessary to get the maximum performance out of
                  all the materials perform maximum in producing a concrete. Â·
